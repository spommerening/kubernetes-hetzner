[mark-control-plane] Marking the node kube01-master03 as control-plane by adding the taints [node-role.kubernetes.io/master:NoSchedule]

This node has joined the cluster and a new control plane instance was created:

* Certificate signing request was sent to apiserver and approval was received.
* The Kubelet was informed of the new secure connection details.
* Control plane (master) label and taint were applied to the new node.
* The Kubernetes control plane instances scaled up.
* A new etcd member was added to the local/stacked etcd cluster.

To start administering your cluster from this node, you need to run the following as a regular user:

	mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
	sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
	sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

Run 'kubectl get nodes' to see this node join the cluster.
